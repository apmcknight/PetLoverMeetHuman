        <h4>We started Pet Lover Meet Human in 2015 with the purpose  to connect pet lovers with thier
        perfect lover. We don’t have a magic formual or algrothim. . . We know pet-lovers really, really well!
        I merried Jill in 2010 after meeting in 2005. After that glorious day, we added three new family members to the mix.
        Two glorious birds, and two monkeys—yes you read that right—monkeys! We loved that we both loved animals exactly the
        same! And now three years later, we’re still going strong!</h4>
